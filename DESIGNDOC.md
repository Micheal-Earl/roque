## Gameplay
Plays like a traditional roguelike (DCSS, TOME, C:DDA). Anything you could do on a tile based grid will likely be implemented (Aoe spells, auras, line spells). There will be a crafting system inspired by C:DDA.  

Character creation will be similar to C:DDA with a point based system and flaws/boons that you can take.

## Player Experience
_What is the player experience from character creation to end game?_

---

## Character
_What makes up a player character (or a cultivator in general) within the game?_

#### Race
_Not 100% sure whether there will be races or not_
- Human
- Asura
- Deva

#### Stats
_Still need to make decisions on what each of these stats will actually. I'll probably prune some of them to reduce complexity._
- Strength
- Endurance
- Intellect
- Agility
- Spirit
- Charisma
- Luck

#### Crafting skills
_Crafting will be similar to C:DDA, players will be able to use objects surrounding their character to craft new things. There will be tools like Cauldrons with qualities (ex: Pill Distillation 2). These qualities + ingredients + the characters proficiency in the crafting category + known recipes determine what they can or cannot craft at any given moment._
- Pill refinement
  - Cauldron
  - Furnace
  - etc
- Weaponcraft
- Armorcraft
- Toolcraft
  - A support specialization to craft tools for other crafting specializations
- Formations
- Talismans
- Automatons (puppetcraft)
- Technique Crafting?

#### Qi
_There will be many kinds of Qi in the game. These Qi types can fuel certain techniques. A player can theoretically train in any number of Qi types, but will progress much more slowly than someone who chooses to focus on only a few._
- The Primary Elements
  - Fire
  - Water
  - Metal
  - Earth
  - Wood
- The Tertiary Elements
  - Thunder
  - Wind
  - Poison
  - Shadow
  - Light
- The Martial Elements
  - Sword
  - Combat
  - Precision
  - ?
  - Slaughter
- The Balance Elements
  - Karma
  - Death
  - Life
  - ?
  - ?

#### Qi Refining
_Qi refining will be one of the main progression tools in the game. You progress through the stages primarily through Qi refinement. The better your Qi refinement technique, the more quickly you can progress. However, not all Qi refinement techniques are made equal and some may require you to satisfy unique constraints to fully utilize them._  

_Qi refinement techniques are tied to one of the 4 main Qi groups (Primary, Tertiary, Martial, Balance) Example: If you have a primary qi refinement technique it can increase your Qi in Fire, Water, Metal, Earth, or Wood._
- Standard Qi Refinement Techniques
- Unique Qi Refinement Techniques
  - Slaughter Refinement
    - You gain Qi cap faster based on how many innocents you've killed since the last time you meditated
  - Gourmand Refinement
    - You gain Qi cap faster based on how much food you've eaten since the last time you meditated

#### Meditation
_You can choose to meditate at any time out of combat. Meditation will slowly increase your maximum Qi cap. The speed at which meditation increases your Qi cap is based on how many experience points you've earned since the last time you've meditated and your qi refinement technique_

#### Boons/Flaws
_During character creation you can take flaws to increase the number of points you have to work with. These flaws could be anything from reducing your baseline reputation with every sect to taking penalties on ranged attack checks. Boons will effectively be the opposite of flaws and cost character creation points instead of granting them._
- Boons
  - ?
    -?
- Flaws
  - Disreputable
    - Your base reputation with every sect has been reduced

#### Cultivation Stages
_You can increase in cultivation current stages once you reach your stages maximum possible Qi cap._
- Qi Condensation
- Foundation Establishment
- Core Formation
- Nascent Soul
- Dao Seeking
- Immortal
- Dao Realm
- Samsara Severing

#### Body Cultivation Stages
- Qi Condensation
- Foundation Establishment
- Core Formation
- Nascent Soul
- Dao Seeking
- Immortal
- Dao Realm

#### Techniques
_Your character will slowly accrue many techniques as you play the game. But, they take time and effort to train in. It will be up to you (and your qi types) to decide which techniques you will train and use. The plan is to have hundreds of techniques to find in game, some super unique, others pretty generic._

#### The Dao
_This idea is a little underdeveloped. The Dao will be a central "belief" of your character and some late game progress will rely on you fulfilling or discovering more about your dao. These daos could be something like "I will vanquish evil!" which may give you stat bonus when fighting "evil" enemies._
- Start with a dao, refine it in dao seeking stage
- I don't know what they do yet, unique techniques, stat bonuses, etc

#### Karmic Balance
- Good/evil deeds etc.

#### Reputation
- Reputation matrix

## World
_The world should slowly open up as your character progresses. The earlier the stage, the smaller the world should feel. This fits with the standard xianxia theme. Eventually as you progress you will even be able to travel to other planets in the solar system._
