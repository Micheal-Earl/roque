## Gameplay
Plays like a traditional roguelike (DCSS, TOME, C:DDA). Anything you could do on a tile based grid will likely be implemented (Aoe spells, auras, line spells). There will be a crafting system inspired by C:DDA.  

Character creation will be similar to C:DDA with a point based system and flaws/boons that you can take.

_Qi refining will be one of the main progression tools in the game. You progress through the stages primarily through Qi refinement.
